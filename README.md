project involves the simulation of a parabolic movement, in which the user can modify variables that modify the behavior of the movement and thus fulfill the goal of the game. The history of our application, takes place in the XVII century where we find Sir Isaac Newton testing his theories and suddenly, Sheldon Cooper, a scientist decided future to check your string theory appears and steals his writings, notes and notes hoping to change the future and become a famous scientist. Seeing this, a group of engineers in training at the Autonomous University of the West used its newest invention, the time machine 2.0 and are determined to help Isaac to retrieve your notes so you can correct the course of history; to meet this end, engineers in training given away a spear projectiles machine additionally allow you to modify certain physical variables of the environment. The game consists of a variety of levels with varying difficulty, there is also the possibility that the user develops a level of his own. The variables that make the dynamic game and the user can change are as follows: - Angle - Power Launch (initial speed of the projectile) - Mass of Projectile Additionally the user has the possibility of firing the projectile when desired. In addition the group thought to simulate gravity change, affecting the behavior of the projectile. The user will be able to create a level of his own, to do this is to ask the user how many obstacles have the level to distance from the firing position is this obstacle, what size it will be. Additionally, the user will define the size of the target to be scoring and how far is the point of origin. The game is controlled by a set of buttons and a joystick established governing variables. This set of controls is connected by line
integrated programmable Arduino board. This hardware-software combination allows the user to have more control of the game.
